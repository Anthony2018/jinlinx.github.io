### **Work Experience**
**AI Research Internship**, Data & Data Science Group, [Sanofi,S.A.](https://www.sanofi.com/en), 06/2023 ~ 09/2024, Boston, MA 

Mentor: Wei Zhao and Bozhao Qi
- Endoscopic Scoring and Localization in Unconstrained Clinical Trial Videos (Accepted at WACV2025)
    - Collected a comprehensive clinical endoscopy dataset through human-in-the-loop active learning, combining video cleaning and weak labeling by doctors to produce a large and balanced dataset (~49.9 hours, ~86,423 clips) for endoscopic mayo scoring
    - Developed an end-to-end foundational model for endoscopic scoring and localization, incorporating a ViT-based scoring model for clip-by-clip assessment and a trajectory model for precise localization, also serving as a vision input for medical multimodal models
    - Introduced a novel personalized Cumulative Disease Score (CDS) based on movement, surpassing the limitations of prior time-based CDS
- Data-driven Neural ODE (DN-ODE) Modeling for Clinical Trails Breast Cancer Tumor Dynamics (Accepted at Neurips DLDE, CBM)
    - Developed a breast cancer pharmacodynamics model using neural ODEs, trained on phase 1/2 Amcenestrant clinical trials and validated in phase 3, which predicts tumor size and progression-free survival (PFS) from initial patient status
    - Offered interpretable results and visualizations of tumor dynamics, serving as a robust reference for clinical trial design by identifying potential responders and patients at risk of cancer progression
- Generative AI & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) web-based Backend
    - Built a chat-based tool for researchers and doctors to review clinical trial documents and interactively find related answers.
    - Developed AWS Lambda backends integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT API for query embeddings and Pinecone for similarity search.
    - Implemented automated tests with SonarCloud checks, ensuring high-quality code through GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.
- Data-Driven Neural-ODE Modeling for Breast Cancer Tumor Dynamics and Progression-Free Probability Predictions 
    - Managed sparse data from early phases of clinical trials and predicted later phases with only a single observation
    -	Created visualizations depicting various tumor dynamics patterns and achieved accurate predictions (R2 exceeding 0.9)
    -	Provided a robust reference for clinical trial design by identifying potential responders and progressed patients
- Unpaired Tissue Segmentation & Virtual Restaining 
    - Proposed an end-to-end unpaired segmentation GAN and virtual staining framework that mimics real staining processes
    - Supervised prior works and presented a promising substitute for traditional histopathology methods for clinical trial recruitment

**Machine Learning Engineer Internship**, [Kernel Lab](https://kernellabs.io/), 01/2021 ～ 08/2021, Seattle, WA.

Mentor: [Dennis Meng](https://kernellabs.io/), Lead Data Scientist at Kernel Labs Inc
- Gender classifier: Design a model to classify a speaker’s gender.
- Echo challenge: Design a Dual-signal Transformation LSTM Network to solve the acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) problems.
